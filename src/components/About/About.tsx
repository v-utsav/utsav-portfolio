          Hello! I'm <strong>John</strong>, a master's student in Computer Science in Germany, originally from Indonesia.
          Iâ€™m passionate about building modern, clean, and responsive UIs with <strong>React</strong>, and I'm growing my
          skills in backend development using <strong>Java Spring Boot</strong>. My long-term goal is to become a full-stack
          engineer with strong DevOps knowledge.
